# Runescape-API

The runescape api is rather clunky to use on its own. As part of another project I'm
working on, making this api wrapper saved a lot of headaches.

All this does is json requests to the official runescape api, and parses those responses
into easy to use classes / instance variables.

Currently focusing on the Grand Exchange, will expand to the Beastiary and High Scores
eventually.
